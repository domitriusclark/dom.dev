# About
Heyo! I'm Domitrius Clark. I transitioned from Retail to Software 8 years ago. Spent my first four years building UI's for companies like Guru and Comcast. I then spent the last four years building my career in Developer Experience & Relations at places like Cloudinary, Netlify, and Clerk. Community is the most important part of any tool and I've spent my career making sure to open doors for developers. 

Outside of work, I play video games, Magic the Gathering, and love Esports. I run a small Youtube & TikTok where I post MTG & other TCG based content!
